# What a Growth Mindset Means to Me

_A growth mindset means remembering it has been a long time since I've been in an organized learning environment, and that it's ok if I need to consistenly remind myself how to learn. It means reminding ourselves why we chose this challenge, and that we did in fact choose it for ourselves. A growth mindset means trying to learn from and enjoy the process as much as the outcome._

_A growth mindset means being ok with a lot of this:_ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ _[^1]

## Three Things to Help Maintain a Growth Mindset

1. Ask for help!  
2. Not only is failing possible, it is part of the process.
3. I'm on my **own journey** for my **own reasons**, not anyone else's.
