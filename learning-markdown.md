# Notes for using Markdown 
- Markdown is a way to style text on the web
- Regular text with some non-alphabetic characters to dictate styling
- Markdown syntax cheat sheets can be found on the internet and are also bookmarked below

## Other important things to remember? 
- GitHub uses their own version of Markdown which is GFM _GitHub Flavored Markdown_
- It's 'markdown' not 'markup'!

## Testing examples out 

1. Here is a nested list
   - I am testing it out to see if it works. 
      - Alas! A nested list.  
      
It would be cool to make a table. Let's try. 

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Is this cool? | Yeah!
Would another row be cool? | Yeah!
