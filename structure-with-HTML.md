### Process to Make a New Site

Important questions to consider re the audience and their needs:

1. Who are your visitors? 
2. Why people visit your website
3. What your visitors are trying to achieve
4. What information your visitors need
5. How often people will visit your site
    - How often you need to update it (maybe different for different parts of site)

## Site Map
*Diagram of the pages that will be used to structure a site*

- Can use **card sorting** to help decide what info should go on each page
- Site map usually begins with homepage at top
- It's possible each page will have its own section homepage as well, if its a large site


## Wireframe
*Simple sketch of key information that needs to go on each page*

- Shows the hierarchy of information and how much space it might require
- Don't worry yet about CSS stuff (color, font, etc) in wireframe phase

**The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate.**

## Design

- Prioritizing 
    - *Visual hierarchy*
- Organizing 
    - *Grouping* related content into *blocks* or *chunks*
    - Present certain types of info in *similar* visual style
