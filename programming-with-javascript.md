Day 4 - Reading 7 - Notes

## Programming with JavaScript

- Access Content
- Modify Content
- Program Rules
- React to Events

Examples:
- Slideshows
- Forms
- Reload part of page
- Filter data

### Script is series of instructions

- Script should state the goal and list the tasks
    1. Define goal
    2. Design script
        - Split goal into series of tasks, flowhcart helpful
    3. Code each step

**Syntax** is how you put words together to create instructions for computer to follow

## Expressions

1. Assign value to a variable
2. Use two or more values to return single value

### Assignment operators
- Assign a value to a variable

### Arithmetic Operators
- Perform basic math, new ones to remember:
    - Increment: ++ adds one to current number
    - Decrement: -- subtracts one from current number
    - Modulus: % divides two values and returns remainder
- **Remember - PEMDAS!**

### String Operators
- Combine two strings
- **concatenation** - the process of joining two or more strings to create one new string
- Quotes around numbers make it a string and it wont be recognized as a number anymore 


## Functions

1. Series of statements grouped together because they perform specific task
2. **Method** is same except created inside (and is part of) and object

- Function name should describe task it's performing, when you ask it to perform task you are **calling** the function
- Steps packaged up in code block
- **Parameters** are pieces of info passed to function 
- **Return value** is the answer to a function
- Functions store code required to perform specific task
- Script asks function to perform that task whenever needed
- **Declaring functions that need information: put parameters in parathensis after function name**
