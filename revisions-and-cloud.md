# Revisions and the Cloud - Day 3 notes 

## Lab 03 Takeaways
- make sure to always ACP!
- during C, if you forget -m "message" after git commit, a new page will pop open in VS Code and you'll have an opportunity to write a commit message there. **GOOGLE THIS LATER** since I am still not sure how to continue on if I find myself here
    - if that happens, you can right click and delete that popup, git status back in Terminal and then git commit -m "  " from there 
- use git status liberally, helps to get used to the commands and remembering where you are
- just keep doing this! practice is what makes you better 
- 'doh' moments are unavoidable 


## Maybe I'll have another heading
