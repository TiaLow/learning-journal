## Design with CSS

*Imagine there is an invisible box around every HTML element.*

*Can link an external .CSS file*

'''<link href="name/name.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/>'''

**Boxes**
- Width and height
- Borders
- Background color and images
- Position in browser window

**Text**
- Typeface
- Size
- Color
- Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small caps

**Specific**
- Specific ways to style certain elements like lists, tables, forms

#### CSS associates style rules with HTML elements
- **Selector**: indicates which element rule applies to
- **Declaration**: indicates how elements referred to in selector should be styled 
    - **Property**: indicate aspects of the element you want to change (can have several separated by semi colon)
    - **Values**: specify settings for chosen properties
