Different classifications of text editors:
- Basic editor that comes with your computer. Basic of basic, doesn't do anything extra for you. Must use a plain text editor (no options for bold, underline, etc)
- Third party options like Visual Studio Code that have some additional features like code completion and syntax highlighting. 

It's important for software developers to be mindful of what text editor to use because ultimately it can make your life writing code easier.

BASIC TERMINAL USAGE

- Command line interface instead of graphical user interface
- Issuing commands to your computer
- Must be a space between the command and first command line argument (or "option")
- Terminal can be found at Applications - Utilities (or command+space and type Terminal)
 (My default interactive shell is zsh)
