## Text Editors
- Basic editor that comes with your computer. Basic of basic, doesn't do anything extra for you. Must use a plain text editor (no options for bold, underline, etc)
- Third party options like Visual Studio Code that have some additional features like code completion and syntax highlighting. 

**It's important for software developers to be mindful of what text editor to use because ultimately it can make your life writing code easier.**

## Basic Terminal Usage

- Command line interface (cli) instead of graphical user interface (gui "gooey")
- Issuing commands to your computer
- Can have multiple terminals open at once to do different things (cool!)
- Must be a space between the command and first command line argument (or "option")
- Terminal can be found at Applications - Utilities (or command+space and type Terminal)

#### NAVIGATION 
- we refer to a file or directory on command line as "path" (a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system) 
  - absolute paths: specify a location in relation to root directory
  - relative paths: specify location in relation to where we currently are in system
- root directory denoted by single backslash and is at the top of the hierarchical structure


#### Command Examples
 - pwd (Print Working Directory): tells you what directory you're currently working in
 - ls (list): gives you the listing of what's in your current directory
 - ls -l (list): indicates a long listing
 - ls /etc (list): list our current directory's contents
