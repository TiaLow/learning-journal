Different classifications of text editors:
- Basic editor that comes with your computer. Basic of basic, doesn't do anything extra for you. Must use a plain text editor (no options for bold, underline, etc)
- Third party options like Visual Studio Code that have some additional features like code completion and syntax highlighting. 

It's important for software developers to be mindful of what text editor to use because ultimately it can make writing code easier.
