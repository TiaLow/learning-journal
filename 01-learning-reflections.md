## 2020 Learning Reflections
### Code 201 and beyond...


#### Tuesday, June 2
*I'm excited about this new experience of learning as an adult, now that I've made such an intentional decision about my future by starting these courses. I tend to get real caught up in the details, which is good in a way because it makes me very detail-oriented, but it can sometimes prevent me from grasping a bigger-picture-concept. I like lists, and I make them all over, so I plan to keep a list throughout the week of bigger-picture concepts I'm having a hard time with. I'll look at that towards the end of my week and see if there's anything I can cross off, if I've had any "ah-ha!" moments throughout the week.*

*Reflection is important to me in my personal life, and I appreciate the space and extra push to do so in my professional life as well.*
