## 2020 Learning Reflections
### Code 201 and beyond...


#### Tuesday, June 2
*I'm excited about this new experience of learning as an adult, now that I've made such an intentional decision about my future by starting these courses. I tend to get real caught up in the details, which is good in a way because it makes me very detail-oriented, but it can sometimes prevent me from grasping a bigger-picture-concept. I like lists, and I make them all over, so I plan to keep a list throughout the week of bigger-picture concepts I'm having a hard time with. I'll look at that towards the end of my week and see if there's anything I can cross off, if I've had any "ah-ha!" moments throughout the week.*

*Reflection is important to me in my personal life, and I appreciate the space and extra push to do so in my professional life as well.*

*Today I'm reflecting on a difficult day, and one where I had to rely a lot on other people to help and where I had to blaze through my frustration and keep working. My prior life and professional experience is already helping me in this new endeavor, and I know it will continue to do so.*

*For one thing, I've done a lot of work on learning more about myself and what I'm looking for in this life, and this new adventure into learning and the doors it will open is a very intentional step towards my other goals. I'm more motivated now to push through the frustration and continue on this journey because I've made such a conscious choice to be here.*

*I've also worked many jobs at this point in my life and been a part of many different work environments. I've worked by myself, I've worked in teams, I've worked with friends and I've also learned how to work with people I find difficult. I think my experience with people will help me in this new endeavor as well.*
