## 2020 Learning Reflections
### Code 201 and beyond...


#### Tuesday, June 2
*I'm excited about this new experience of learning as an adult, now that I've made such an intentional decision about my future by starting these courses. I tend to get real caught up in the details, which is good in a way because it makes me very detail-oriented, but it can sometimes prevent me from grasping a bigger-picture-concept. I like lists, and I make them all over, so I plan to keep a list throughout the week of bigger-picture concepts I'm having a hard time with. I'll look at that towards the end of my week and see if there's anything I can cross off, if I've had any "ah-ha!" moments throughout the week.*

*Reflection is important to me in my personal life, and I appreciate the space and extra push to do so in my professional life as well.*

#### Wednesday, June 3
*Today I'm reflecting on a difficult day, and one where I had to rely a lot on other people to help and where I had to blaze through my frustration and keep working. My prior life and professional experience is already helping me in this new endeavor, and I know it will continue to do so.*

*For one thing, I've done a lot of work on learning more about myself and what I'm looking for in this life, and this new adventure into learning and the doors it will open is a very intentional step towards my other goals. I'm more motivated now to push through the frustration and continue on this journey because I've made such a conscious choice to be here.*

*I've also worked many jobs at this point in my life and been a part of many different work environments. I've worked by myself, I've worked in teams, I've worked with friends and I've also learned how to work with people I find difficult. I think my experience with people will help me in this new endeavor as well.*

*I have many motivations for learning! Some are more general and existential, and others more specific to this new learning adventure.*

*One of the ways I find purpose in life is through the belief that a big part of the reason for it is to learn and (try) to understand as much as we can about the people, cultures, environment and world around us. To travel to try to better understand other humans and their cultures, in order to better understand ourselves and our significance. This feeds my curiosity and my love of learning.*

*More specifically, I have a few motivators for starting these courses and trying to learn computer programming. I'd like to have the skills that will open the door on other opportunities in the future. After working many jobs that didn't challenge me, I'd like to be in an industry and career where I'm always challenged to learn new things by my peers and individually. And in fact, **must** always learn new things in order to stay relevant! It seems you can never really top out in this industry. I'd like to set myself up for better potential to work remotely so that I can do the type of slow traveling that I enjoy. And to be perfectly honest, I'd like to have the type of earning potential to be able to keep up with the **obscenely** expensive and rising costs of living, specifically healthcare, in this country.*

#### Friday, June 5

*I have many 'whys' for being back in school, some more general and others more specific.*

*I'm learning web development as a new profession because I want to be in a career where I can always learn new things, and build upon my skills in a meaningful way. I like to build things, I have a very active imagination, and I'd like to have the tools to be able to build the things I imagine. I'm learning web development to finally set myself up with the tool-belt for a profession I could have for the rest of my working life. I'm learning web development to learn hard skills, after spending a decade and a half in jobs learning soft skills (which are also **very** important!)*

*I'm learning CSS because I care about the aesthetics and design of a page and I think it's important in the way a user interacts with a page.*


#### Monday, June 8

*One of my internal forces for learning is independence. I greatly value my independence and no matter what my changing circumstances in life may be, it's important to me to feel confident I'll be able to support myself. One of the ways I hope to grow this confidence is through this current learning endeavor, to acquire the skills to maintain relevancy in a changing workforce.*

#### Tuesday, June 9

*Today I'm reflecting on a very challenging day, which is actually a great lead-in to this learning journal reflection. So far the most unexpected part of this experience is frankly how much of a challenge it all is for me.*

*I knew this would be **a challenge** and I knew I would struggle,  but I'm having a difficult time accepting the struggle. It has been a very long time since I've had to try so hard to understand something, and that prolonged frustration has been difficult for me. It an interesting juxtaposition because it's both discouraging **and** motivating.*

*Even though I know it's "normal" to feel behind, and "normal" to feel frustrated, and "normal" to feel **imposter syndrome**, it's still been difficult for me to sit for so long in that. I am trying to get more comfortable with that feeling, and I am trying to accept the encouragement from instructors and peers, and it's all part of the process.*

*Today I learned that I really do know more than I think I know! I relied heavily on the help of the TAs and my classmates the last couple days, and today while refactoring my code I spent a bit of time really reading everything through, top to bottom, trying to make sure I actually understood the work I'd done. It sunk in a bit more, and in trying to work through the last bit of the problem I realized I actually did have the knowledge I needed to solve it.*

*I'm trying to find a balance between challenging myself to spend the serious brainpower and time to work through the problems myself, knowing when the Google machien is my best bet, and when I should be asking for help from the TAs and my class. I've never been great at asking for help, and that has been one of the big challenges of this for me so far.*

*I believe the learning pyramid displayed does pretty much reflect the ways I best learn in the appropriate percentages. If anything I would swap Reading and Lecture, as I believe I retain more from hearing spoken word than reading.*

*I wholeheartedly agree with learning by doing and learning by teaching being the most effective ways to learn!*

#### Friday, June 12 - Sunday, June 14

*Today I'm reflecting on **imposter syndrome** and to what extent I experience those feelings. Now that I understand this phrase, I can recognize that it is something I've experienced to different degrees throughout my life. When I think of big life changes I've made, whether it be starting a new job in a new field, or leaving the country to travel for a year, I've admit I've felt this to some extent. At the moment, in this new endeavor, I've fluctuated between about a 3 and a 7 on a scale of 1-10. It depends on the day and the task, and if I've been able to prove to myself that I understand something.*

*I recognize that experiencing this feeling can get in the way of asking for help, and I am really trying to break the mold when it comes to that. It also helps to know that my peers are experiencing the same sort of feelings. There is some sense of comfort is a shared sense of imposter syndrome!*

*Today I learned that it is ok to take it down a notch, go at my own pace during lab, and do what's best for me to solidify the learning. I was a bit all over the place last week during the Salmon Cookies project, and I relied on a lot of help from TAs which I definitely needed, but in hindsight it may have prevented me from learning it the best I could. This week I decided that I wanted to be a bit more methodical about it and slow down to let the concepts and code stick a bit more. I realized it would be beneficial for me to spend more time on the early stages of the process, like wireframing and building the CSS bones. I also decided I wanted to code along with a replay of the lecture today, so I could go at my own pace and start and stop when I needed. Consequently I find myself with just a half hour of normal lab time left, significantly behind my peers in the process of building today's lab. But **I recently learned** that this is ok! What's important is that I'm learning, not that I'm finishing first.*

**Experience is what you get when you didnâ€™t get what you wanted.**

*I'm still working on developing and sticking to strategies to learn from the disappointments, so that the net experience becomes productive and positive. One thing I try to do everyday is end the day on a positive note. Even if I'm knee deep frustrated in a lab, I try to at least remember or say out loud what my small wins were for the day (or last few hours). I try to remind myself that I'm choosing to be here!*

*In this course so far I have experienced both ends of the spectrum, where something has been more difficult for me to learn that I expected it to be and also where it has been easier than expected. I expected the logic-based stuff of JavaScript to come easier to me, having previously really enjoyed math class! But I've found it to be a different kind of logic-based math than when I was expecting that has been much more challenging!*

*One thing that has come easier to me than I thought was getting back into the swing of a structured learning environment. It's been over 10 years since school for me, and a couple months since I had the responsiblity of a 8-5 job, and I was anticipating a much more rugged transition to the strucutre of these days. I've been in the mindset for a while that I would throw myself into this, so that helped in getting used to everything. I've found I really enjoy being around peers again, and being inspired and learning from the people I'm spending my days with.*

#### Thursday, June 18

*Today I learned that even if I remember having successful group projects back in university (over 10 years ago!) every team and group interaction is different, and that just having a laid-back and flexible personality might not cut it! Team interaction needs to be active and intentional and can sometimes take a decent amount of work for it to not have to feel like too much work.* 

#### Friday, June 19 - Sunday, June 21

***What have you learned from the process of keeping a learning journal?***

*Throughout the process of keeping a learning journal, I've learned that the overall process of reflection is important to me in order to check in throughout this new learning endeavor. I've kept journals in the past and I've always felt the benefit. I'm a person who appreciates having the additional time to think on something, as sometimes it takes me a while to digest the bigger-picture things. I've learned that I need some time to step back and reflect, in order to feel a bit grounded. It provides book-ends to my day, in a sense.*
