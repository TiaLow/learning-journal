Day 4 - Reading 8 - Notes

## Operators

== : is equal to <br>
!=: is not equal to <br>
===: strict equal to <br>
!==: strict not equal to <br>
 (greater than, less than, greater than or equal >=, less than or equal <=)

- **Comparison operators** usually return values of true or false
-**Logical operators** allow you to compare results of more than one comparison operator
    - && is logical and
    - /|| is logical or
    - ! is logical not
- **Logical expressions are evaluated left to right**

## Loops

- **Loops check a condition**
### For
- Run code for specific number of times
- Usually condition is counter, used to tell how many times loop should run
    - Initialization
    - Condition
    - Update

### While
- Code continues to loop as long as condition is true

### Do While
- Like while but will always run statements in curlys at least once even if condition evaluates to false
